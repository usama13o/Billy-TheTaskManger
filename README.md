# Billy – The Task Manager

Rich drag & drop calendar scheduling + brain dump workflow. Normally the kind of interactive scheduling / resizing UX you only see locked inside paid SaaS products – open‑sourced here so you can learn, extend, and self‑host.

</div>

## ✨ Key Features

- Brain Dump Inbox: Create tasks quickly (title, description, tags, priority) without needing to schedule them immediately.
- Week Calendar (30‑min grid): 7‑day, 24h view sliced into 30‑minute slots (now with taller 40px rows for readability).
- Drag & Drop Scheduling: Drag from brain dump into any half‑hour slot; automatic assignment of date + start time.
- In‑Calendar Move: Grab any scheduled task block and drag vertically to a new start time (whole block is draggable).
- Resize Duration: Pull the bottom grip to extend/shrink a task; duration snaps to 30‑minute increments and updates the stored time estimate.
- Priority Color System: High / Medium / Low priorities propagate consistent border + background accents across cards and calendar blocks.
- Prevent Accidental Clicks: Resize interactions won’t open the edit modal on mouseup.
- Auto Scroll to Start Hour: Calendar auto‑positions to 9 AM on first load for faster context.
- Current Time Indicator: Red line + dot in today’s column for temporal orientation.
- Dark Themed Scrollbars & UI: Tailwind + subtle glassy backgrounds; custom scrollbar styling.
- Local Persistence: All tasks stored in `localStorage` (with cross‑tab sync) – no backend required.
- Safe Defaults: Initial sample tasks show structure; no external services needed.
- Tags Support: Displayed on cards & inside taller calendar blocks.
- Responsive-ish Layout: Horizontal scroll for full week + vertical scroll for hours.
- Open Source Friendly Stack: Lightweight, modern, no heavy state framework.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Interactive calendar task blocks with true drag, drop, resize, and color semantics are usually gated inside proprietary productivity tools. This repo demonstrates how to build that UX with:

- Clear data model (tasks + week derivation)
- Predictable time math (30‑minute slot indexing)
- Simple persistence layer (can later swap to IndexedDB / server)
- Minimal but powerful drag engine (dnd‑kit)

Use it as a learning scaffold or the base for your own productivity app.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

- React 18 + TypeScript
- Vite (fast dev + build)
- Tailwind CSS (utility styling + dark theme)
- dnd-kit (drag/drop + sortable + sensors)
- date-fns (date math & formatting)
- lucide-react (icons)
- uuid (ID generation)

## 📂 Project Structure (High Level)

```
src/
	components/
		CalendarView.tsx   // Week grid, droppables, TaskBlock rendering
		TaskCard.tsx       // Reusable task card (sortable / static modes)
		BrainDump.tsx      // (If extended) Inbox list (not yet elaborated here)
		WeeklyBoard.tsx    // Board / alt views (future extensibility)
	hooks/
		useTasks.ts        // Core task state + persistence + derived week days
	types/               // Task & calendar type definitions
	App.tsx              // DnD context + top-level wiring
```

## 🗃️ Data Model (Task)

```ts
interface Task {
	id: string;
	title: string;
	description?: string;
	timeEstimate: number;      // minutes
	priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
	status: 'pending' | 'in-progress' | 'completed';
	createdAt: Date;
	scheduledDate?: string;    // YYYY-MM-DD
	scheduledTime?: string;    // HH:mm (start)
	tags: string[];
}
```

Duration displayed in the calendar is derived from `timeEstimate` (mutable via resize). End time = start time + timeEstimate.

## 🔄 Persistence Layer

- Implemented via `localStorage` key `taskManager.tasks.v1`.
- On load: JSON parsed, `createdAt` rehydrated to `Date`.
- On every task mutation: state serialized.
- Cross‑tab Sync: `storage` event listener updates memory state if another tab writes changes.

To upgrade later: Replace persistence section inside `useTasks.ts` with IndexedDB or remote API fetch/patch calls.

## 🧮 Time & Slot Math

- 24h * 2 = 48 half‑hour slots.
- Index formula: `index = hour * 2 + (minute >= 30 ? 1 : 0)`.
- Pixel top: `index * slotHeight` (slotHeight = 40).
- Resize: Pointer deltaY → nearest slot delta → minutes = base + (deltaSlots * 30).

## 🧲 Drag & Drop Overview

- Brain dump tasks: Sortable / draggable sources (dnd‑kit `useSortable`).
- Calendar slots: Each slot is a droppable with ID pattern: `slot|<date>|<HH:mm>`.
- Calendar blocks: Draggable vertically (whole surface) using `useDraggable` to reposition.
- Drop handling (in `App.tsx`): Parse droppable ID, update `scheduledDate` + `scheduledTime`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Node 18+ (recommended) & npm (or pnpm/yarn if you adapt commands).

### Install
```bash
npm install
```

Create a `.env` (or preferably `.env.local`) file with:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_ANON_KEY_HERE
```
Never commit service role keys; only the public anon key belongs here.

### Run Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open the printed localhost URL (typically http://localhost:5173/).

### Lint
```bash
npm run lint
```

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
```
Preview the build:
```bash
npm run preview
```

## 🖱️ Usage Tips

- Drag unscheduled task → calendar slot to schedule.
- Click a scheduled block to edit (future: modal editing can be extended).
- Resize from the bottom grip to change duration (snaps to 30m).
- Drag scheduled block vertically to move it; release over new slot.
- Tasks with longer height show more metadata (description, tags).

## 🔐 No Backend Yet

Everything is local. If you clear browser storage you lose tasks (export / import coming soon). For multi‑device sync you can bolt on a small API (Next.js / Express / Supabase, etc.).

## 🛣️ Roadmap / Ideas

- Overlapping task auto layout (multi‑column stacking)
- Horizontal drag to move between days directly
- Keyboard accessibility for move / resize
- IndexedDB persistence + export/import JSON
- Filter & search panel (priority, tag, status)
- Recurring task templates
- Focus / “Now” mode with countdown
- Offline-first + sync conflict resolution
- Theming (light / custom palettes)

## ✅ Supabase Sync Checklist (WIP Tracking)

Status markers: [ ] = pending, [x] = done, [~] = partial.

- [x] Environment variable for anon key (`VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) – no hard‑coded secret
- [x] Basic client integration (`supabaseClient.ts`)
- [x] Initial fetch + merge of remote tasks
- [x] Live realtime subscription (insert/update/delete)
- [x] Outbound writes (add/update/delete → upsert/delete)
- [ ] Debounce / throttle bulk upsert (currently every state change triggers one)
- [ ] Add `updated_at` column + conflict resolution (last write wins right now)
- [ ] Proper error handling + retry queue (fire & forget currently)
- [ ] Row Level Security policies (open policies if public demo; tighten for auth)
- [ ] Auth + `user_id` column (scoped multi‑user data isolation)
- [ ] Migration SQL scripts (`sql/` folder) for reproducible schema
- [ ] Index optimization review after real usage (baseline indexes suggested)
- [ ] Offline change queue + reconciliation after reconnect
- [ ] Export / import (JSON) to supplement remote sync
- [ ] Selective / incremental sync (diff instead of full upsert set)
- [ ] Unit tests around mapping (Supabase row <-> Task)
- [ ] Observability: console noise replaced with structured logger / metrics hooks

Suggested table additions for future steps:
```sql
alter table public.tasks
	add column if not exists updated_at timestamptz not null default now();
create index if not exists tasks_updated_at_idx on public.tasks(updated_at);
```

Future auth (after enabling Supabase Auth):
```sql
alter table public.tasks add column if not exists user_id uuid references auth.users(id);
create index if not exists tasks_user_id_idx on public.tasks(user_id);
-- Policies (example)
create policy "Task Select" on public.tasks for select using (auth.uid() = user_id);
create policy "Task Modify" on public.tasks for all using (auth.uid() = user_id) with check (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

Conflict strategy sketch:
1. Store `updated_at` locally.
2. When pushing update: include last known `updated_at`.
3. If server row `updated_at` is newer, fetch + merge (or prompt user).
4. On realtime payload, only apply if `payload.updated_at > local.updated_at`.
